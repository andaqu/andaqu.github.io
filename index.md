Hello! I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the [School of Computing and Information](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/), [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu/). I shall be working under the guidance of [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/) within the [Computational Social Dynamics Lab](https://picsolab.github.io/).

My research interests encompass the fields of <span style="color:blue;">computational social science</span> and <span style="color:darkgreen;">natural language processing</span>. I aim to contribute to the development of <span style="color:yellow;">responsible AI technologies</span> that aim to <span style="color:orange;">bridge social divides</span>. The research questions that particularly intrigue me, each informing the next, are as follows:

<ol>
  <li>How does the study of language use inform our understanding of <span style="color:blue;">human social behaviour</span>?</li>
  <li>How can we build NLP applications that <span style="color:yellow;">cater for the needs of marginalised populations</span> and diverse backgrounds?</li>
  <li>How can we apply such technologies to <span style="color:orange;">steer communities towards improving their well-being</span>, including but not limited to improving their mental health and mitigate conflicts?</li>
</ol>


I have previously graduated with a master‚Äôs in AI from Stockholm University, where I worked with a Ph.D student from Spotify to investigate how podcast comprehension can be improved using a pipeline combining topic segmentation and text summarisation methods. I was advised by [Prof. Panagiotis Papapetrou](https://papapetrou.blogs.dsv.su.se/) and [Maria Movin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariamovin).

Before my move to Stockholm, I also completed my bachelor‚Äôs in AI at the University of Malta, where I worked with [Dr. Charlie Abela](https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/charlieabela) to explore the relationship between users‚Äô Big Five personality traits and the social connections they create within a real-world Twitter network.

## A bit about me

üèùÔ∏è I'm from a very small island in the Mediterranean called Malta. It's a beautiful country, you should come visit! [If you're considering a trip, my friend's website has some great information.](https://www.todoinmalta.com/)

üïπÔ∏è My all-time favourite video game has to be the original Deus Ex. One of the best stories ever told in a game. I served as a beta tester for an overhaul mod called [Deus Ex: Revision](https://store.steampowered.com/app/397550/Deus_Ex_Revision/), which I highly recommend.

üëÅÔ∏è I have mild red-green colour blindness. Go figure.

üêß I used to have a blog about Club Penguin when I was 12. I had even convinced my mum to buy me a .com domain for it! It was a simpler time.

üç´ A hill I'd die on? Mint chocolate is humanity's greatest mistake.

üå≥ Living in Sweden for a couple of years made me realise how much I value proximity to nature. Nothing better than a walk in the woods to clear your head.

üöµ I learnt how to ride a bike at the age of 23. Never too late to learn!
